# 📊 Cash Flow Forecasting & Analysis – Python & Excel

This project demonstrates a complete cash flow forecasting and analysis pipeline using both Python and Excel.

It includes:

- Monthly revenue and expense forecasting
- Net cash flow and cumulative cash calculations
- Data visualization with Matplotlib (Python)
- Excel version with visual enhancements
- Pivot table summary with quarterly insights

---

# 1. Python Analysis (Colab / Jupyter)

Using Python, we simulated a 12-month cash flow dataset and analyzed:

- Net Cash Flow = Revenue - Expenses  
- Cumulative Cash = Sum of net cash month by month  
- Visualized trends using Matplotlib

# Key Observations:
- No month had a negative cash flow
- Cumulative cash rose steadily
- A slight dip in revenue was noticed in Sep–Oct, followed by quick recovery
- Cash was accumulating — a suggestion was made to consider reinvestment

---

# 2. Excel Analysis

The same dataset was recreated in Excel with:
- Conditional Formatting to flag potential risk
- Data Bars for quick visual pattern detection
- Line chart comparing Revenue, Expenses, and Net Cash Flow
- Data Labels added for clear interpretation

#  Visual Summary:
> “This graph helped identify stable growth and highlighted any slight seasonal dips in cash flow. Excel remains
