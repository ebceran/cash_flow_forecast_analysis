# Cash Flow Forecasting & Cumulative Analysis (Project 2)
This project simulates monthly revenue and expense data using Python and visualizes both net cash flow and cumulative cash position over a one-year period.

# Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

pandas

matplotlib

Google Colab

# What This Project Shows:
Stable revenue and net positive monthly cash flow

Two months (Sep & Oct) with a revenue dip

Cumulative cash grows consistently over time

# Financial Insights:
# Is the cumulative cash flow positive by year-end?
Yes, and not just positive, but growing steadily every month. The curve shows an impressive upward trend, suggesting healthy financial operations.

# Any months with a drop in revenue?
Yes. From August to September, revenue dropped from £21,000 to £19,000 — a decline of approximately 9.5%.
Then again from September to October, revenue fell to £18,500 — a smaller drop of around 2.6%.
Although these dips occurred, the business quickly recovered and ended the year with record-high revenues.

#  Any months with negative cash flow?
No, all months remained in positive net cash flow territory. This indicates strong cash management and operational consistency.

 # Strategic Observation:
The company is accumulating a large amount of cash without signs of reinvestment.
From a strategic point of view, holding idle cash can be a missed opportunity.
Reinvesting into expansion, innovation, or product development could further accelerate growth.
